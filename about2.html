                    <br>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">What I see myself in 10 years is I will become a programmer or developer in my age of 30.
                        During that time, I may have degree in Bachelor Of Information Systems (Hons.) Intelligent Systems Engineering.
                        Through this journey, I may become more passionate to become the programmer as I have face many 
                        obstacles during my study life until I age 30. I also want to pursue my study to Master or PHD in the Computer Science as
                        now my ambition had changed which is I want to build my own software company in the future.</p>

                      <br>
                      <blockquote>
                        <p style="text-align: center;"><i>"What defines us is how we rise after falling"</i></p>
                      </blockquote>
                      <br>
                      <p style="text-align: justify;"> In this quote, it tell that rising above the challenge and standing up 
                          after we fall, define who we are. All those mistakes that we have is only make us stronger. 
                          We need to tell to ourselves:-</p>
                          <ul>
                              <li>If I want to achieve my dreams, I need to rise up.</li>
                              <li>If I want to be a successful, I need to find better version of myself.</li>
                          </ul>
                          <p style="text-align: justify;">We must set into our mind, these problems not last forever. It just want to taught us in 
                        how to rise after we fall or have bad days. Yet, I found this quote really help to comfort me when I felt down
                          or when I have bad day. I will always look and read this quote for me to become positive
                          again and for that I put this quote's as my wallpaper phone. So that, I can read it 
                          every morning before I start my day! <br><br>
