                                    such as cabbage, cucumber and kale at the small garden beside my house.

                                    I had a lot of scarves which is more than 60 scarves. This was because when 
                                    I go to shopping mall, I like to buy a new scarves and sometimes the color
                                    of the scarves are just slightly different but I still bought it because for me,
                                    it was beautiful.

                                    I really love to streaming music when I study or when I cook. I usually play

                                <p>
                                    I love to solve the mathematic problem rather than to memorize a books. It was
                                    because it really hard for me to memorize a lot of word and I usually take lot of
                                    time just to simple memorize a few pages.
